/*
I want to build a video game where you are controlling 2 character in a turn based game.
- The only 2 thing that the user can customize is the type of warrior and name you'll be using
- Each warrior have 3 moves (1 attack, 1 buff (ally) or debuff (enemy) and 1 fusion)
- Fusion combines all stats (Health Points, attack, defense and speed), moves (instead of 2 moves, it will be 4) and their names! (First Half and Second Half)
